    <h1>About the Stuxnet Cyber Attack</h1>
    <p>The Stuxnet cyber attack, which came to light in 2010, was a groundbreaking event in the history of cyber warfare. This sophisticated attack specifically targeted Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, particularly the Natanz facility.</p>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Stuxnet was a computer worm discovered in 2010 that was designed to sabotage industrial equipment. It is widely believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel to hinder Iran's nuclear capabilities. The worm was designed to infect the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems controlling centrifuges used in uranium enrichment.</p>

    <h2>Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Stuxnet was discovered in June 2010, though it is believed to have been active for several years before that.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The worm was programmed to cause centrifuges to spin at varying speeds, leading to physical damage and malfunction.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The attack caused significant delays in Iran's nuclear program and highlighted the vulnerabilities of industrial control systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Understanding Cybersecurity Task-6,7,8</h1>
    
    <p>
        Cybersecurity is a critical aspect of modern technology. It involves protecting computer systems, networks, and data from <strong>cyber threats</strong> such as hacking, phishing, and malware. In this article, we will explore some essential concepts in <em>cybersecurity</em> to help you understand how to safeguard your digital information.
    </p>

    <p>
        One fundamental concept in cybersecurity is the use of <b>encryption</b>. Encryption transforms readable data into an <q>unreadable format</q> that can only be decrypted by authorized individuals. For example, when you send a message over the internet, encryption ensures that only the intended recipient can read it. The basic idea is to use algorithms to encode the data, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is widely used to secure sensitive information.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another important aspect of cybersecurity is understanding different types of <i>malware</i>. Malware can include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Viruses</strong>: Malicious code that attaches itself to legitimate programs.</li>
            <li><b>Worms</b>: Self-replicating malware that spreads without user intervention.</li>
            <li><em>Trojan horses</em>: Malicious software disguised as legitimate programs.</li>
            <li><ins>Spyware</ins>: Software designed to collect user information without consent.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        It's also crucial to be aware of common <sub>cybersecurity</sub> threats and preventive measures:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Regularly update your software to protect against <sup>vulnerabilities</sup> and exploits.</li>
            <li>Use strong, unique passwords for different accounts and employ <b>multi-factor authentication</b> (MFA) for additional security.</li>
            <li>Be cautious of phishing attempts and <del>scams</del> that attempt to steal personal information.</li>
            <li>Regularly back up your data to prevent loss in case of an attack.</li>
        </ul>

        </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        The most famous <sub>cybersecurity</sub> attacks and victims:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Attacks:</li>
            <ol>Stuxnet (2010)
                <ol>
                Attacker was Israel
            </ol>
            <ol>Victim was Iran</ol><br>
            <button title="Stuxnet Attack"   class="s2"><a href="about.html" class="s2">Read</a></button>
            </ol><br>
            <ol>Yahoo Data Breach (2013-2014)</ol>
            <ol>WannaCry Ransomware Attack (2017)</ol>
           
        </ul>
